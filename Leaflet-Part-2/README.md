In Part 2, we extend the Earthquake Visualization by adding tectonic plate boundaries to the map. The tectonic plates data is sourced from GitHub and displayed alongside earthquake data. The map allows users to explore the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Additionally, users can toggle between different map layers and datasets.
